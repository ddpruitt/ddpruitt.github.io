      <description>Last week, Gartner predicted that mobile would be a trillion-dollar industry by 2014. It&amp;rsquo;s a market Microsoft doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be shut out of.&#xA;via Why is Microsoft suddenly so hot for HTML5? | Betanews.&#xA;This and my earlier post reinforce my belief that it is time to break the chains of Microsoft. Meaning it is time for me to stop being a Mort.</description>

      <title>Value Objects as Measurement Objects</title>

      <description>So I was reviewing PEAA looking to see if Fowler had come up with the idea of Measurment Objects, that horse I&amp;rsquo;ve been kicking around lately. I found that he has a couple of close patterns: Value Object and Money.&#xA;Value Object: A small simple object, like money or a date range, whose equality isn&amp;rsquo;t based on identity.&#xA;Money: Represents a monetary value.&#xA;According to Fowler Value Objects are light weight and almost primative types.</description>

      <description>In my previous post I described setting up a database to track measurements. I ran into problems quickly with the data model and I could see that it was going to become a convoluted mess pretty quick. So I want to take a step back and look at it from an application point of view.&#xA;What I want is a way to track an objects measurements. I need a system that is easy to understand, any one looking at an object should readily understand what each measurement property is and what units it is in.</description>

      <description>I am sick of working with databases, they all suck. I can generalize this to any type of data store, they all suck.&#xA;OK, they don&amp;rsquo;t really suck but I sure have seen a lot of database designs that do. I am tired of working with applications that have lots and lots of large tables, tables with lots and lots of fields. Of course all the fields but the primary key are nullable because you might not always need that extra address field but it is there, just in case.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reviewing the ExcelPackage project on CodePlex. It is a useful project but one thing I was wondering is why does it directly interact with the XML?&#xA;I think it is a performance and a code maintenance hit to work directly with the XML for the workbook and worksheets. In my oh so humble opinion I think it would be easier to create plain old C# objects to work with the cells, rows, sheets, etc.</description>

      <description>Why is it that so many crappy apps are out there in the wild?&#xA;Is it because of the visual tools available in the .Net realm that generate so much crap that the average programmer just does not have time to clean it up? Or are the developers just too lazy to clean up the mess as they go?</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t want to use any Office InterOperability (as that sucks) and I know I can do it using ADO.Net. But since 1.) I hate writing all of that DataAdapter / Connection code because 2.) I am lazy I decided to see how hard it would be to use the EntLib DAB.</description>

      <description>I have started doing more scratch programming, one off little bits of code that I use and throw away.

I am loosing my touch.&#xA;Like any thing else, if you don&amp;rsquo;t use it you loose it.&#xA;When I create projects I like to follow a specific file structure.</description>

Consistent Package Installation&#xA;In windows you have MSI files to install stuff with. They are simple to use and pretty much standard for every program I&amp;rsquo;ve installed.&#xA;In Linux I&amp;rsquo;ve used RPM&amp;rsquo;s, APT and PORTAGE.</description>

      <description>Just got an email about the 6.0 version of the VMWare Workstation and all I can say is &amp;ldquo;Wow!&amp;rdquo; These are the features I am mainly interested in:&#xA;Multiple monitor display - You can configure a VM to span multiple monitors, or multiple VMs to each display on separate monitors. Integrated Virtual Debugger - Workstation integrates with Visual Studio and Eclipse so you can deploy, run, and debug programs in a VM directly from your preferred IDE Headless mode - You can run VMs in the background without the Workstation UI These new features will help me at work as it really does fit into my work style.</description>

      <description>I have several Open Source projects I am following and to facilitate downloading the code I created a simple NAnt script. The script worked great until the other day one of the projects started failing to update.&#xA;Most of the projects I&amp;rsquo;m tracking are in Subversion. All I&amp;rsquo;m doing is checking out the trunk then about once or twice a week doing an update. So when the project started failing to update I figured it would be a simple matter of deleting the project folder and just checking it out again.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with VMWare and vitalization for a while now and I have to say I really like it. I have a virtual Ubuntu image that I am using to learn Ruby on Rails with. I installed VMWare&amp;rsquo;s server on my file server so I can run VM&amp;rsquo;s from any PC in my house.&#xA;So last night I was working on my gateway PC when the thought hit me: Why not create my own virtual domain?</description>

      <description>I am working on automating our build process and one of the things I am trying to do now is to add FxCop to the mix. There are a couple of ways to run the process, one using an exec task to call the executable directly, the other is through a Contrib task .&#xA;I tried the first method with no success. For some reason I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the output file name to be recognized by the executable.</description>

      <description>Why waste everyone&amp;rsquo;s time with a bunch of meaningless just-in-case wrapper code? Start with the simplest thing that works&amp;ndash; a public variable. You can always refactor this later into a property if it turns out additional work needs to be done when the name value is set. If you truly need a property, then use a property. Otherwise, KISS! Update: As many commenters have pointed out, there are valid reasons to make a trivial property, exactly as depicted above:</description>

      <description>Ok, so I found another alternative to BlogJet: Performancing. This is an extension of FireFox so I have to have that installed.&#xA;So far it looks like it is easy to use. It can&amp;rsquo;t seem to be able to insert an image like Live Writer but I think it will be easier to blog about something I found on the web.&#xA;I have a feeling I will keep using Live Writer and only use this on occasion.</description>

      <description>So I just heard about the Windows Live Writer Beta. I am a big fan of BlogJet so when I heard about this new Microsoft program I was skeptical. So far I like it.&#xA;Now if it uploads this picture then I will have a reason to start using it and not use BlogJet.&#xA;I am always on the lookout for new and better tools. If this does what I need it to do then I will switch to it.</description>

YouTube and Google Video are the start of that phenomena.&#xA;The thing I just found out about YouTube is that you can embed videos in any post and not worry about actually hosting the video. See my post on the Blue Man Group for an example.</description>

      <description>I upgraded my Gallery from 1.5 to 2.1 and man am I freaking impressed! Between WordPress and Gallery the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on with ASP.NET look like total crap.&#xA;The upgrade process was really easy. Rename my original gallery folder, make sure it still works, install the new gallery, import the old. The new Gallery uses MySql where as the 1.5 version only used folders to manage the albums.</description>

      <description>I moved my permanent blog to here, if you hadn’t noticed. It went a whole lot smoother than I thought it would as my main blog was on Blogger.com. I had this sinking feeling that in order to move all my entries I would have to save them one by one then repost them. Boy was I surprised!&#xA;I had originally given thought to switching my hosting to use ASP.Net, the only hold back was that my gallery was using Gallery.</description>

      <description>I’ve have discovered virtualization. Actually I started using it several months ago and found that it is GREAT! It Rocks My World!!&#xA;After trying Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s I decided that I preferred VMWare’s Virtual Server, mainly because there is a version for Linux. I have a plan to build the ultimate home server using VM’s.&#xA;However, tonight I had just downloaded the SourceForge Enterprise VM and was going to play with it but my license key for VMWare Virtual Server had expired.</description>

      <description>OK, so I have seen bad code in the past. Hell, I’ve written some pretty bad code in the past, present and will in the future. But what I am looking at right now just blows my freaking mind.&#xA;A stored procedure that generates dynamic SQL to parse an XML document stored in a table which then somehow drives a cursor to fetch one row from something the dynamic sql calls that then drives another cursor that uses OPENXML to get data from another xml document.</description>

      <description>So, we are doing XP want to be development at work. It is more of a war room programming environment and not true paired programming. What I am finding that I like more and more is not the coding per say, but the testing and development automation. I have been using TestDriven.NET and mbUnit a lot and am just now starting to explore NCover. Also, have been using NAnt scripting for builds and have installed CruiseControl.</description>

      <description>I’ve tried several Linux distributions: Redhat, Coral, Suse, Mandrake, Damn Small Linux, Knoppix, Gentoo and finally Debian. Of all of these I was most loyal to Gentoo because it was the distro I learned the most with. The problem with Gentoo though is you spend so much time getting it to run and tweaking it that you don’t really get to use the machine for what you want to.&#xA;For example, I tried and successfully setup a Gentoo desktop on a couple of occasions.</description>

      <description>I am getting ready to ride out Hurricane Rita. We have a room set up with food, water and other supplies. We tried to evacuate but got stuck in traffic; in six hours we only went five miles. By that time we were down to half a tank of gas so we opted to return home. We even thought about attempting it again later that night but the roads were still clogged and there was no gas to be found.</description>

      <description>I finished reading Sandman #9, The Kindly Ones. This was a very complicated Sandman, and for the Sandman saga that is saying something. Almost all the old characters returned and a lot of loose threads were tied or cut. Then Neil killed Dream.&#xA;I thought, how inappropriate. I didn’t think he would actually kill him, just make him wipe out the furies. But no, Dream goes bye-bye.&#xA;This was actually foreshadowed in the previous Sandman, with the storm and the funeral march.</description>

The philosophy of the library is to extend the base class library (BCL) of collection classes that will be available with .NET 2.0 rather than provide a complete and separate set of classes from .NET.</description>

      <description>World of Warcraft was finally released last year (w00t!) and for Christmas my wife bought me the Limited Edition. Of course she did not realize what that meant, after all I had been waiting for three years for WOW to come out!&#xA;I am focusing mainly on creating Warriors for now. I have created four different characters, two on a Pacific server and two on one of the Central servers. I found that the Pacific servers are always over crowded and more prone to lag and other issues so I switched to the Central servers.</description>

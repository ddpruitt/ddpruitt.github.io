      So I was reviewing PEAA looking to see if Fowler had come up with the idea of Measurment Objects, that horse I&rsquo;ve been kicking around lately. I found that he has a couple of close patterns: Value Object and Money.
Value Object: A small simple object, like money or a date range, whose equality isn&rsquo;t based on identity.
Money: Represents a monetary value.
According to Fowler Value Objects are light weight and almost primative types.

      In my previous post I described setting up a database to track measurements. I ran into problems quickly with the data model and I could see that it was going to become a convoluted mess pretty quick. So I want to take a step back and look at it from an application point of view.
What I want is a way to track an objects measurements. I need a system that is easy to understand, any one looking at an object should readily understand what each measurement property is and what units it is in.

OK, they don&rsquo;t really suck but I sure have seen a lot of database designs that do. I am tired of working with applications that have lots and lots of large tables, tables with lots and lots of fields. Of course all the fields but the primary key are nullable because you might not always need that extra address field but it is there, just in case.

I think it is a performance and a code maintenance hit to work directly with the XML for the workbook and worksheets. In my oh so humble opinion I think it would be easier to create plain old C# objects to work with the cells, rows, sheets, etc.

Integrated Virtual Debugger - Workstation integrates with Visual Studio and Eclipse so you can deploy, run, and debug programs in a VM directly from your preferred IDE Headless mode - You can run VMs in the background without the Workstation UI These new features will help me at work as it really does fit into my work style.

      I&rsquo;ve been playing around with VMWare and vitalization for a while now and I have to say I really like it. I have a virtual Ubuntu image that I am using to learn Ruby on Rails with. I installed VMWare&rsquo;s server on my file server so I can run VM&rsquo;s from any PC in my house.
So last night I was working on my gateway PC when the thought hit me: Why not create my own virtual domain?

      Why waste everyone&rsquo;s time with a bunch of meaningless just-in-case wrapper code? Start with the simplest thing that works&ndash; a public variable. You can always refactor this later into a property if it turns out additional work needs to be done when the name value is set. If you truly need a property, then use a property. Otherwise, KISS! Update: As many commenters have pointed out, there are valid reasons to make a trivial property, exactly as depicted above:

      OK, so I have seen bad code in the past. Hell, I’ve written some pretty bad code in the past, present and will in the future. But what I am looking at right now just blows my freaking mind.
A stored procedure that generates dynamic SQL to parse an XML document stored in a table which then somehow drives a cursor to fetch one row from something the dynamic sql calls that then drives another cursor that uses OPENXML to get data from another xml document.

      So, we are doing XP want to be development at work. It is more of a war room programming environment and not true paired programming. What I am finding that I like more and more is not the coding per say, but the testing and development automation. I have been using TestDriven.NET and mbUnit a lot and am just now starting to explore NCover. Also, have been using NAnt scripting for builds and have installed CruiseControl.

      I’ve tried several Linux distributions: Redhat, Coral, Suse, Mandrake, Damn Small Linux, Knoppix, Gentoo and finally Debian. Of all of these I was most loyal to Gentoo because it was the distro I learned the most with. The problem with Gentoo though is you spend so much time getting it to run and tweaking it that you don’t really get to use the machine for what you want to.
For example, I tried and successfully setup a Gentoo desktop on a couple of occasions.

      I finished reading Sandman #9, The Kindly Ones. This was a very complicated Sandman, and for the Sandman saga that is saying something. Almost all the old characters returned and a lot of loose threads were tied or cut. Then Neil killed Dream.
I thought, how inappropriate. I didn’t think he would actually kill him, just make him wipe out the furies. But no, Dream goes bye-bye.
This was actually foreshadowed in the previous Sandman, with the storm and the funeral march.

      <description>Adding user defined functions to Excel can be laborious, either you use VBA or COM. Why can&amp;rsquo;t Microsoft make it easier to use Visual Studio and .NET within Excel?&#xA;Enter ExcelDna.&#xA;This example creates a static function in C# using Visual Studio. There is documentation that already describes this, what I am adding is:&#xA;Use Visual Studio to create project&#xA;Post Build Events to help create the final XLL file.</description>

      <description>Spirograph&amp;rsquo;s are cool. See here and here.&#xA;I put together three ways to generate points for a Spirograph, first using a Brute Force straight generate the points, second using a Parallel.For and third using LINQ.&#xA;Two important classes first. First is a static DoubleExtension class to help determine when two doubles are about equal:&#xA;using System; namespace DC.SpiroGraph.Core { public static class DoubleExtension { public static bool AboutEqual(double x, double y) { double epsilon = Math.</description>

      <title>FileSystemWatcher With the BlockingCollection</title>
      <link>https://example.org/2011/10/filesystemwatcher-with.html</link>

      <guid>https://example.org/2011/10/filesystemwatcher-with.html</guid>
      <description>While working with the FileSystemWatcher I found that if too many files were created the built in buffer will overflowed and files will be skipped. After much research I found out about the Producer-Consumer Problem. Then I found that .Net 4 has the BlockingCollection which helps solve the issue. But how to use it with the FileSystemWatcher?&#xA;On StackOverflow I found Making PLINQ and BlockingCollection work together. I&amp;rsquo;m not so interested in the PLINQ issue but this is a great example of using The BlockingCollection with FileSystemWatcher.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of code to generate SQL statements. Invariable the programmer has an array of strings that they loop through (for example to put into an IN clause) and they always have a check to see of the current item is the first or last in the list. The typical usage is to have a StringBuilder and an if statement which determines if an extra comma (or plus sign or whatever) is added or left out.</description>

Silverlight also has some “sweet spots” in media and line-of-business applications, he said.&#xA;But when it comes to touting Silverlight as Microsoft’s vehicle for delivering a cross-platform runtime, “our strategy has shifted,” Muglia told me.&#xA;via Microsoft: Our strategy with Silverlight has shifted | ZDNet.&#xA;I think it is time to move away from the Microsoft platform. I&amp;rsquo;m getting tired of having to learn a new framework every year just to keep up with their changes.</description>

      <description>The utility of the week is FileHelpers, a .Net library that works with delimited and fixed length files. It helps to import and export data from files, strings or streams.&#xA;I found this recently as I needed to process several CSV files but I did not want to write by hand a parser. Been there, done that way too many times so I did a search and what do you know- someone smarter than me already did it.</description>

      <description>Found the following in the article ASP.NET MVC: Using RESTful Architecture and thought it worth noting. It describes what the MVC command actions should be, no more than this is needed:&#xA;The endpoint needs to be something meaningful, and Rails uses a nice convention that divides the endpoints into 7 main bits:&#xA;Index - the main “landing” page. This is also the default endpoint. List - a list of whatever “thing” you’re showing them - like a list of Products.</description>

      <description>I have a love-hate relationship with DataSets. On the one hand they are easy to use and contain lots of built in functionality. On the other hand they are abused by almost everyone but at the same time severely under utilized, meaning that I rarely see anyone use most of the features available.&#xA;I get the feeling that the majority of developers that use DataSets have blinders on: DataSets are only useful for reading and writing data to the database.</description>

Our unit test rely on the state of our database and this has caused so many issues that I&amp;rsquo;m hesitant to even run them.&#xA;To fix the issue I have started working with TypeMock.Net an AOP mocking tool. TypeMock will intercept calls to objects that are called by the code you are testing without actually creating or executing the object.</description>

      <description>Now that we have this cool Validation Application Block we want to use it with all our business objects. This should immediately send up a red flag that there will probably be some common functionality among all these business objects in how they use the Validation Application Block. Hence some type of layer supertype ( business base class ) will probably be necessary to contain common functionality to remove code redundancy.</description>

      <description>I have had the joy of reviewing other peoples code lately and I must say that for the most part there is a total lack of attention to detail. Extensive use of copy paste coding, but the one thing that bugs me the most is the naming convention used.&#xA;Can you believe that there are still developers that preface there variables with obj?! Is that not just crazy? Of course it is an object, we work in an OOP language.</description>

      <title>Switched Back to ReSharper</title>

      <description>I uninstalled CodeRush and re-installed ReSharper. CodeRush just wasn&amp;rsquo;t doing anything for me productivity wise. I felt that I spent more time fighting it then working with it.&#xA;Maybe I just feel more comfortable with ReSharper. I feel that with it I don&amp;rsquo;t have to memorize as many key combinations.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll give it another month and see what I think then.</description>

      <title>Building a build server with CC.NET</title>

      <description>So I have started implementing CruiseControl.Net at work and I have to say it is pretty fun. I’ve built a bunch on Nant scripts to build our SOA middle tier, installed CC.Net and setup the first project.&#xA;What I am struggling with now is getting VSS to update the source files. I think I am just missing something small but for some reason I can’t get the files to update.</description>

      <title>Reading .NET Configuration Files</title>

      <description>I am currently working on a small app that will scan our environment and verify that all the configuration settings are correct. One thing I found was that you can’t open just any .config file using System.Configuration, it has to be named the same as the calling assembly.&#xA;What a pain.</description>

      <title>Resharper vs CodeRush</title>
      <link>https://example.org/2006/06/resharper-vs-coderush.html</link>

      <guid>https://example.org/2006/06/resharper-vs-coderush.html</guid>
      <description>So I used Resharper for a long time and I really liked it. There were a few things I didn’t like, especially the time added to a project load. And every once in a while it would lock up. But the features I liked were very useful: Find all usages, simple keyboard shortcuts, code reformatting. But the two most useful things it did was 1) to but a bar along the right side of the screen with orange or red lines for were the code had problems, and 2) clean up the using statements.</description>

      <title>Semi-XP Development</title>

      <description>So, we are doing XP want to be development at work. It is more of a war room programming environment and not true paired programming. What I am finding that I like more and more is not the coding per say, but the testing and development automation. I have been using TestDriven.NET and mbUnit a lot and am just now starting to explore NCover. Also, have been using NAnt scripting for builds and have installed CruiseControl.</description>

      <description>Comment found in a code that I was reviewing:&#xA;if we got this far, then everything is working properly&#xA;Why does this send shivers up my spine? The procedure is 91 lines long and this comment appears on line 43. What about the other 48 lines? What if they fail? I should add the following comment to the end of the procedure:&#xA;if we got this far then there is a God.</description>

      <title>CF Form Disposal</title>
      <link>https://example.org/2004/11/cf-form-disposal.html</link>

      <guid>https://example.org/2004/11/cf-form-disposal.html</guid>
      <description>The December 2004 issue of MSDN contains an article on developing CF apps. Part of the article advocates the disposing of forms as soon as you are done using them in order to conserve memory. I disagree with this.&#xA;I have found that caching forms improves the performance of a CF application. It takes a long time to load a form in CF so why should I make the user wait every time he has to reopen the same form?</description>

      <title>Period Matirx Twisting</title>

      <description>The Period Matrix table, Pd_Matrix, is used in calculating accounting period formulas. These formulas include current month, quarter or years activity or balance. These formulas can also be created using standard SQL functions but not all functions are common between SQL Server and MS Access. The Period Matrix has the advantage in that it can be used in any DBMS and it also can be used in table pivoting and folding.</description>

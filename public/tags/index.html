The DFRobot&rsquo;s Wireless Joystick V1.1 is similar in size and shape to an XBox controller. The controller, or gamepad as it is also referred to, is an Arduino Deumilanove w/ATMega 328 and requires either an FTDI Basic Breakout or USB Serial Light Adapter to program. The board uses 3.3V, when connecting either the FTDI or USB Adapter verify correct voltage is set on the adapter, via jumpers on the adapter, otherwise you will burn out the gamepad.

      I’ve tried several Linux distributions: Redhat, Coral, Suse, Mandrake, Damn Small Linux, Knoppix, Gentoo and finally Debian. Of all of these I was most loyal to Gentoo because it was the distro I learned the most with. The problem with Gentoo though is you spend so much time getting it to run and tweaking it that you don’t really get to use the machine for what you want to.
For example, I tried and successfully setup a Gentoo desktop on a couple of occasions.

      While working with the FileSystemWatcher I found that if too many files were created the built in buffer will overflowed and files will be skipped. After much research I found out about the Producer-Consumer Problem. Then I found that .Net 4 has the BlockingCollection which helps solve the issue. But how to use it with the FileSystemWatcher?
On StackOverflow I found Making PLINQ and BlockingCollection work together. I&rsquo;m not so interested in the PLINQ issue but this is a great example of using The BlockingCollection with FileSystemWatcher.

      I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of code to generate SQL statements. Invariable the programmer has an array of strings that they loop through (for example to put into an IN clause) and they always have a check to see of the current item is the first or last in the list. The typical usage is to have a StringBuilder and an if statement which determines if an extra comma (or plus sign or whatever) is added or left out.

      The utility of the week is FileHelpers, a .Net library that works with delimited and fixed length files. It helps to import and export data from files, strings or streams.
I found this recently as I needed to process several CSV files but I did not want to write by hand a parser. Been there, done that way too many times so I did a search and what do you know- someone smarter than me already did it.

      I created a simple ICommand interface similar to the one in System.Windows.Input:

      The December 2004 issue of MSDN contains an article on developing CF apps. Part of the article advocates the disposing of forms as soon as you are done using them in order to conserve memory. I disagree with this.
I have found that caching forms improves the performance of a CF application. It takes a long time to load a form in CF so why should I make the user wait every time he has to reopen the same form?

      So I was reviewing PEAA looking to see if Fowler had come up with the idea of Measurment Objects, that horse I&rsquo;ve been kicking around lately. I found that he has a couple of close patterns: Value Object and Money.
Value Object: A small simple object, like money or a date range, whose equality isn&rsquo;t based on identity.
Money: Represents a monetary value.
According to Fowler Value Objects are light weight and almost primative types.

Multiple monitor display - You can configure a VM to span multiple monitors, or multiple VMs to each display on separate monitors. Integrated Virtual Debugger - Workstation integrates with Visual Studio and Eclipse so you can deploy, run, and debug programs in a VM directly from your preferred IDE Headless mode - You can run VMs in the background without the Workstation UI These new features will help me at work as it really does fit into my work style.

      Why waste everyone&rsquo;s time with a bunch of meaningless just-in-case wrapper code? Start with the simplest thing that works&ndash; a public variable. You can always refactor this later into a property if it turns out additional work needs to be done when the name value is set. If you truly need a property, then use a property. Otherwise, KISS!

      If you are serious about the practice of software development, you should avoid SourceSafe.
SourceSafe poisons the minds of software developers.
Coding Horror: Source Control: Anything But SourceSafe.
Visual Source Safe sucks. Jeff Atwood explains in no uncertain terms why it sucks and I just want to get my vote in. The two most important issues he points out is that VSS gives the illusion of safety and VSS users DON’T BRANCH!

      I have been saying for the last couple of years that once we get true TV on demand we will stop becoming slaves to the networks. YouTube and Google Video are the start of that phenomena.
The thing I just found out about YouTube is that you can embed videos in any post and not worry about actually hosting the video. See my post on the Blue Man Group for an example.

For example, I tried and successfully setup a Gentoo desktop on a couple of occasions.

This was actually foreshadowed in the previous Sandman, with the storm and the funeral march.

      OK, so I have seen bad code in the past. Hell, I’ve written some pretty bad code in the past, present and will in the future. But what I am looking at right now just blows my freaking mind.
A stored procedure that generates dynamic SQL to parse an XML document stored in a table which then somehow drives a cursor to fetch one row from something the dynamic sql calls that then drives another cursor that uses OPENXML to get data from another xml document.

      I finished reading Sandman #9, The Kindly Ones. This was a very complicated Sandman, and for the Sandman saga that is saying something. Almost all the old characters returned and a lot of loose threads were tied or cut. Then Neil killed Dream.
I thought, how inappropriate. I didn’t think he would actually kill him, just make him wipe out the furies. But no, Dream goes bye-bye.
This was actually foreshadowed in the previous Sandman, with the storm and the funeral march.

      A big problem I have with people who consider themselves programmers is that they spend most of their time chasing the technology. They spend more time whack-a-mole code hacking and no time trying to learn the basics, like source control, methodologies or algorithms.
I personally lack in these areas because I do not come from a Computer Science background, but I strive to overcome this. My favorite computer books deal with ways of thinking about and doing programming, not just code cookbooks.

Discussion of when to use cloud vs own metal. Short answer:
When you need that extra boost in bandwidth due to being slammed with requests. Basically don&rsquo;t just jump to the cloud because it is &lsquo;cool&rsquo;, use the cloud if it saves you money.

      Found the following in the article ASP.NET MVC: Using RESTful Architecture and thought it worth noting. It describes what the MVC command actions should be, no more than this is needed:
The endpoint needs to be something meaningful, and Rails uses a nice convention that divides the endpoints into 7 main bits:
Index - the main “landing” page. This is also the default endpoint. List - a list of whatever “thing” you’re showing them - like a list of Products.

      I was looking into reducing the number of database round trips that LINQ to SQL took and found an article by David Hayden that fit the bill. I wanted to see what was actually happening so I slapped together a simple demo.
Using the Pubs database I created a console app, added the LINQ to SQL classes then created a simple repository class:
public class AuthorRepository { public author GetAuthorWithTitles(string authorId) { var db = new PubsDataClassesDataContext(); return db.

      I was working on a stored procedure the other day, not one that I wrote originally but one that was causing performance issues in out system. The procedure was taking any where from 40 to 60 seconds to run, which is unacceptable in a web service. This in fact was causing the web service to time out.
An inspection of the execution plan showed that one part of the procedure was doing an index scan and that it was this that was taking up over 85% of the execution time.

      Pivoting a table on multiple columns with a crosstab query gets messy really fast. To eliminate the need for complicated Multiple Value Field Queries you can use the lowly IIF() function and the obscure CHOOSE() function to pivot a table.
Activity Table The table Activity used in this example has the following layout:
AcctID DeptID Class Year BeginBalance Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec The AcctID and DeptID refer to account and department numbers, which are a part of our fictitious company’s accounting key.

      CrossTab queries are an easy way in MS Access to pivot tables. They are limited in that you can only pivot on one field and can only aggregate one field.
As an example we look at Activity table in the Sample.mdb. If we were asked to show the January activity for each account - department combination for each year using a crosstab query, we would create the following SQL:
TRANSFORM Sum(Activity.

Of course the real GI Joe&rsquo;s head wouldn&rsquo;t have come off so easy. Growing up we used to regularly abuse them by dropping them off of roofs, blowing them up with fire works, running them over with the car, etc.

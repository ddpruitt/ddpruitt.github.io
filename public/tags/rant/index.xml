      <description>Last week, Gartner predicted that mobile would be a trillion-dollar industry by 2014. It&amp;rsquo;s a market Microsoft doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be shut out of.&#xA;via Why is Microsoft suddenly so hot for HTML5? | Betanews.&#xA;This and my earlier post reinforce my belief that it is time to break the chains of Microsoft. Meaning it is time for me to stop being a Mort.</description>

      <description>“Silverlight is our development platform for Windows Phone,” he said. Silverlight also has some “sweet spots” in media and line-of-business applications, he said.&#xA;But when it comes to touting Silverlight as Microsoft’s vehicle for delivering a cross-platform runtime, “our strategy has shifted,” Muglia told me.&#xA;via Microsoft: Our strategy with Silverlight has shifted | ZDNet.&#xA;I think it is time to move away from the Microsoft platform. I&amp;rsquo;m getting tired of having to learn a new framework every year just to keep up with their changes.</description>

      <title>DataSet: More reasons to not like it</title>

      <description>So I am still living in the world of DataSets, when will I ever learn?&#xA;The task was simple, take the contents of DataSetA and merge it into DataSetB. Sure, just use:&#xA;DataSetA.Merge(DataSetB, true) and life will be good. But wait! Why is it when I try to save the merged data from DataSetB to the database it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up?&#xA;Because the RowState of all the rows in all the tables are set to Unchanged!</description>

      <title>Using IDataErrorInfo for Validation</title>
      <link>https://example.org/2009/01/using-idataerrorinfo-for-validation.html</link>

      <guid>https://example.org/2009/01/using-idataerrorinfo-for-validation.html</guid>
      <description>I read an article on CodeProject titled Total View Validation where the author complains that IDataErrorInfo is inadequate for WPF validation. The assumption he makes is that all the validation code needs to go into the IDataErrorInfo.this[string] property as such:&#xA;public string this[string name] { get { string result = null; if (name == &amp;#34;Age&amp;#34;) if (this.age &amp;lt; 0 || this.age &amp;gt; 150) result = &amp;#34;Age must not be less than 0 or greater than 150.</description>

      <title>DataSets - Love em Hate em</title>

      <guid>https://example.org/2008/02/datasets-love-em-hate-em.html</guid>
      <description>I have a love-hate relationship with DataSets. On the one hand they are easy to use and contain lots of built in functionality. On the other hand they are abused by almost everyone but at the same time severely under utilized, meaning that I rarely see anyone use most of the features available.&#xA;I get the feeling that the majority of developers that use DataSets have blinders on: DataSets are only useful for reading and writing data to the database.</description>

      <description>Why is it that so many crappy apps are out there in the wild?&#xA;Is it because of the visual tools available in the .Net realm that generate so much crap that the average programmer just does not have time to clean it up? Or are the developers just too lazy to clean up the mess as they go?</description>

      <description>My Dad originally made a living as an auto machinic and working on cars is still his favorite pass time. Besides working on cars my Dad liked to swap cars. Swap cars, car parts, you name it he would swap it. The benefit of that to me was that I was exposed (read - drove) to a lot of different cars, some clunkers some not.&#xA;One of the cars he swapped for was a Chevy Vega with a 327 small block V8 in it.</description>

      <description>I have had the joy of reviewing other peoples code lately and I must say that for the most part there is a total lack of attention to detail. Extensive use of copy paste coding, but the one thing that bugs me the most is the naming convention used.&#xA;Can you believe that there are still developers that preface there variables with obj?! Is that not just crazy? Of course it is an object, we work in an OOP language.</description>

      <description>I keep seeing the commercial for Gears of War, I don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about the game but the background music is one that I know and like. It is called &amp;ldquo;Mad World&amp;rdquo; and I recognize it from the movie Donny Darko. Part of it goes like this:&#xA;I find it kind of funny,&#xA;I find it kind of sad,&#xA;But the dreams in which I&amp;rsquo;m dying&#xA;Are the best I ever had.</description>

      <description>I just got a Blackberry for work and am having a hard time dealing with it. I didn’t ask for it but if I have to use it I will. The real problem I am having is the clash of Outlook rules and my use of folders to organize email&amp;rsquo;s. Because the email&amp;rsquo;s I get are moved into a folder (me being the anal organizational type) they do not get forwarded to the Blackberry.</description>

      <description>I like listening to Scott Hanselmin on Hanselminutes. I first noticed Scott while listening to .Net Rocks, the Podcast that was around before the term Podcast. Scott always knows all the cool tools, the most informative websites and alternative ways (read: Not .NET) ways of doing things. His show is great.&#xA;But then there is Carl. Let’s not forget that Hanselminutes is Hosted by Carl Franklin. Carl sounds like the Java guy I work with; every time Scott brings up something that is not Microsoft or .</description>

      <description>Today I was told that:&#xA;In general, interfaces should be used sparingly as they add unneeded complexity when applied to a simple set of objects.&#xA;I don’t get it, I thought interfaces were a Good Thing. I must be missing something….</description>

      <guid>https://example.org/2006/06/resharper-vs-coderush.html</guid>
      <description>So I used Resharper for a long time and I really liked it. There were a few things I didn’t like, especially the time added to a project load. And every once in a while it would lock up. But the features I liked were very useful: Find all usages, simple keyboard shortcuts, code reformatting. But the two most useful things it did was 1) to but a bar along the right side of the screen with orange or red lines for were the code had problems, and 2) clean up the using statements.</description>

      <description>Why should the government be responsible for paying for my kids education? After all, he is my kid so why should local, state, or federal tax money go to improve his education?&#xA;Because the USA will benefit from my son being educated. The State (meaning local, state and federal governments) will benefit by my son making more money, which means he will spend more, so in both cases he will contribute to the economy and the tax base.</description>

      <description>OK, so I have seen bad code in the past. Hell, I’ve written some pretty bad code in the past, present and will in the future. But what I am looking at right now just blows my freaking mind.&#xA;A stored procedure that generates dynamic SQL to parse an XML document stored in a table which then somehow drives a cursor to fetch one row from something the dynamic sql calls that then drives another cursor that uses OPENXML to get data from another xml document.</description>

      <description>I finished reading Sandman #9, The Kindly Ones. This was a very complicated Sandman, and for the Sandman saga that is saying something. Almost all the old characters returned and a lot of loose threads were tied or cut. Then Neil killed Dream.&#xA;I thought, how inappropriate. I didn’t think he would actually kill him, just make him wipe out the furies. But no, Dream goes bye-bye.&#xA;This was actually foreshadowed in the previous Sandman, with the storm and the funeral march.</description>

      <description>So says my bossman at least. And such is the attitude of a lot of programmers.&#xA;But it is not All That Matters. It is a side affect of doing things right and an accident when you do things wrong. There is more to building software, lots more, and it is unfortunate that some people will never see beyond the short sided goals of &amp;ldquo;Making it Work.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;It kills me to here people I work with say that.</description>

      <description>A big problem I have with people who consider themselves programmers is that they spend most of their time chasing the technology. They spend more time whack-a-mole code hacking and no time trying to learn the basics, like source control, methodologies or algorithms.&#xA;I personally lack in these areas because I do not come from a Computer Science background, but I strive to overcome this. My favorite computer books deal with ways of thinking about and doing programming, not just code cookbooks.</description>

I get the feeling that the majority of developers that use DataSets have blinders on: DataSets are only useful for reading and writing data to the database.

      OK, so I have seen bad code in the past. Hell, I’ve written some pretty bad code in the past, present and will in the future. But what I am looking at right now just blows my freaking mind.
A stored procedure that generates dynamic SQL to parse an XML document stored in a table which then somehow drives a cursor to fetch one row from something the dynamic sql calls that then drives another cursor that uses OPENXML to get data from another xml document.

      Those Who Ignore Standards Are Doomed to Reinvent Them The most Prophetic words I have ever heard.
This has come into play several times where I work and where I have worked. It boils down to each developer thinking his set of Standards is better then my set of Standards.
The others should just face reality: I know best so do it my way.

      I finished reading Sandman #9, The Kindly Ones. This was a very complicated Sandman, and for the Sandman saga that is saying something. Almost all the old characters returned and a lot of loose threads were tied or cut. Then Neil killed Dream.
I thought, how inappropriate. I didn’t think he would actually kill him, just make him wipe out the furies. But no, Dream goes bye-bye.
This was actually foreshadowed in the previous Sandman, with the storm and the funeral march.

I am planning on writing up a full doc on my take on the pattern and an implementation of it, based off of the MyXaml MxStateMachine. I like the looks of MyXaml but it seems too declarative for me.

      So says my bossman at least. And such is the attitude of a lot of programmers.
But it is not All That Matters. It is a side affect of doing things right and an accident when you do things wrong. There is more to building software, lots more, and it is unfortunate that some people will never see beyond the short sided goals of &ldquo;Making it Work.&rdquo;
It kills me to here people I work with say that.

      A big problem I have with people who consider themselves programmers is that they spend most of their time chasing the technology. They spend more time whack-a-mole code hacking and no time trying to learn the basics, like source control, methodologies or algorithms.
I personally lack in these areas because I do not come from a Computer Science background, but I strive to overcome this. My favorite computer books deal with ways of thinking about and doing programming, not just code cookbooks.

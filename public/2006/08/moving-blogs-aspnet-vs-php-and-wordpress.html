<p>I had originally given thought to switching my hosting to use ASP.Net, the only hold back was that  my <a href="http://www.ddpruitt.net/gallery">gallery</a> was using <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/">Gallery</a>.  But since I am a .NET developer I thought “why not use something I know?”  Wrong attitude!  It would cost me more to use a .Net server plus after looking around there were not a whole lot of options when it came to applications.  There is DotNetNuke, dasBlog or SubText, plus a handful of galleries.  From what I saw none of those approach the maturity of the PHP options. </p>
<p>I settled on WordPress mainly because I have used it before.  I’ve used numerous CMS applications but I do not want a CMS.  I want a blog engine and a gallery.  The hosting company provided Gallery already which I use and like, and it does offer PHPNuke but that would not fit my needs.</p>
<p>So how to handle the migration?  Turns out that is all built into WordPress.  When I saw that I could import my entire Blogger site I was amazed!  The whole installation process was simple and enjoyable.  The migration took all of fifteen minutes and that is only because I had to figure out how to dump the two blog entries I had at LiveJournal.</p>
<p>Why did I leave blogger?  I am a adamant fan of almost every thing Google and I have had that blog for ages, but I felt like I had to fight the system more than I needed to.  If I wanted categories I would have to either create separate blogs or encode the titles then have some funky search going on.  I think the one thing that really made me want to switch was that I could not select individual entries.  How lame is that?</p>
<p>But I am here now.  My own domain.  My own little space in the wild.</p>

<p>I have been using CodeRush/Refactor Pro for about a month now and really like it as well.  I wish it did some of the things that ReSharper did and I wished the refactoring worked more like ReSharper.  But I like the polish a lot better and I like the way it shows how blocks of code are related.  One of the best features I notices so far is the showing cyclonic complexity of each method.  The code completion is a bit complicated and I haven’t spent enough time figuring it out.  It is more flexible than ReSharpers.</p>
<p>Another thing I do not like about CodeRush is the subscription scheme they are switching to.  I can see where they would need a continuous money stream to keep the business going.  But how am I going to justify paying the CodeRush tax each year when I got the ReSharper upgrade for free?</p>
<p>So, I like both products.  I tried running both at the same time in VS 2003 but after 15 minutes it locked up.  The tend to step on each other a lot so I need to figure out how to get them to play nice together.</p>

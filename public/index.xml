      <description>This is my version of the ever popular to build RoboTank. It uses an Arduino Mega 2560 with the AdaFruit motor shield and an XBee S1 to communicate to the DFRobot Gamepad. The sketch for the RoboTank makes use of the AFMotor.h to drive the motors and includes a serial parser to read and process the commands coming from the Gamepad.&#xA;Robotank-Sketch.zip&#xA;DFRobot Wireless Joystick&#xA;Item Model Source Unit Price Quantity Cost DFRduino Mega 2560 (Arduino Mega Compatible) DFR0127 DFRobot $35.</description>

      <description>Wireless Joystick Sketch&#xA;Wireless Joystick Schematic&#xA;DFRobot Wiki Page&#xA;The DFRobot&amp;rsquo;s Wireless Joystick V1.1 is similar in size and shape to an XBox controller. The controller, or gamepad as it is also referred to, is an Arduino Deumilanove w/ATMega 328 and requires either an FTDI Basic Breakout or USB Serial Light Adapter to program. The board uses 3.3V, when connecting either the FTDI or USB Adapter verify correct voltage is set on the adapter, via jumpers on the adapter, otherwise you will burn out the gamepad.</description>

      <description>Adding user defined functions to Excel can be laborious, either you use VBA or COM. Why can&amp;rsquo;t Microsoft make it easier to use Visual Studio and .NET within Excel?&#xA;Enter ExcelDna.&#xA;This example creates a static function in C# using Visual Studio. There is documentation that already describes this, what I am adding is:&#xA;Use Visual Studio to create project&#xA;Post Build Events to help create the final XLL file.</description>

      <description>Spirograph&amp;rsquo;s are cool. See here and here.&#xA;I put together three ways to generate points for a Spirograph, first using a Brute Force straight generate the points, second using a Parallel.For and third using LINQ.&#xA;Two important classes first. First is a static DoubleExtension class to help determine when two doubles are about equal:&#xA;using System; namespace DC.SpiroGraph.Core { public static class DoubleExtension { public static bool AboutEqual(double x, double y) { double epsilon = Math.</description>

      <title>FileSystemWatcher With the BlockingCollection</title>

      <guid>https://example.org/2011/10/filesystemwatcher-with.html</guid>
      <description>While working with the FileSystemWatcher I found that if too many files were created the built in buffer will overflowed and files will be skipped. After much research I found out about the Producer-Consumer Problem. Then I found that .Net 4 has the BlockingCollection which helps solve the issue. But how to use it with the FileSystemWatcher?&#xA;On StackOverflow I foundÂ Making PLINQ and BlockingCollection work together. I&amp;rsquo;m not so interested in the PLINQ issue but this is a great example of using The BlockingCollection with FileSystemWatcher.</description>

      <description>Excel does not have a running total feature or function built in. All the examples I found on the web to do running totals included VBA code. Not that I have anything against VBA but I thought there should be a way to do running totals with built in worksheet functions.&#xA;Enter our one of our favorite functions: OFFSET(). But first, what is a running total?&#xA;A running total is when you have a list of Values and you want to total of the current Value with the Previous values.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of code to generate SQL statements. Invariable the programmer has an array of strings that they loop through (for example to put into an IN clause) and they always have a check to see of the current item is the first or last in the list. The typical usage is to have a StringBuilder and an if statement which determines if an extra comma (or plus sign or whatever) is added or left out.</description>

      <description>With all the brew ha ha going on about how Delicious is going to be dumped I made a backup of my Delicious bookmarks. While I was at it I created a quick utility to parse the export file so I could play with the links and tags.&#xA;Key to parsing the file was the HTML Agility Pack.

Creators of web search engines were among the first to confront this problem. Today, social networks, mobile phones, sensors and science contribute to petabytes of data created daily.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;What other types of large data sets can we use this approach on? The Oil &amp;amp; Gas industry deals with tons of data so maybe SMAQ can be used with it.</description>

This is also the default endpoint. List - a list of whatever âthingâ youâre showing them - like a list of Products.</description>

      <description>jqGrid takes a specific format for its json (taken from jqGrid documentation):&#xA;{ total: &amp;#34;xxx&amp;#34;, page: &amp;#34;yyy&amp;#34;, records: &amp;#34;zzz&amp;#34;, rows : [ {id:&amp;#34;1&amp;#34;, cell:[&amp;#34;cell11&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;cell12&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;cell13&amp;#34;]}, {id:&amp;#34;2&amp;#34;, cell:[&amp;#34;cell21&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;cell22&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;cell23&amp;#34;]}, ... ] } The tags mean the following:&#xA;total - Total number of Pages. page - Current page Index. records - Total number of records in the rows group. rows - An array with the data plus an identifier. id - The unique row identifier, needs to be an int from what I have found.</description>

      <description>I was looking into reducing the number of database round trips that LINQ to SQL took and found an article by David Hayden that fit the bill. I wanted to see what was actually happening so I slapped together a simple demo.&#xA;Using the Pubs database I created a console app, added the LINQ to SQL classes then created a simple repository class:&#xA;public class AuthorRepository { public author GetAuthorWithTitles(string authorId) { var db = new PubsDataClassesDataContext(); return db.</description>

      <description>I have two tables in a typed DataSet and I want to compare one column in each table to see if TableA has values that are not in TableB.&#xA;IEnumerable&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; valuesInA = typedDataSet.TableA.AsEnumerable().Select(row =&amp;gt; row.AField); IEnumerable&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; valuesInB = typedDataSet.TableB.AsEnumerable().Select(row =&amp;gt; row.BField); foreach (var notInB in valuesInA.Except(valuesInB)) Debug.WriteLine(string.Format(&amp;#34;Value not in TableB.BField: {0}&amp;#34;, notInB)); This is assuming that both AField and BField are the same type.</description>

      <description>So I am still living in the world of DataSets, when will I ever learn?&#xA;The task was simple, take the contents of DataSetA and merge it into DataSetB. Sure, just use:&#xA;DataSetA.Merge(DataSetB, true) and life will be good. But wait! Why is it when I try to save the merged data from DataSetB to the database it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up?&#xA;Because the RowState of all the rows in all the tables are set to Unchanged!</description>

Yeah, Access sucks but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a choice in the matter.&#xA;The app itself is used to import a bunch of CSV files into the Access database. It is more of a utility program and it has going through several variations, from being a simple hand driven command line tool to being GUI driven.&#xA;The command line version was all hand controlled.</description>

      <description>I have a love-hate relationship with DataSets.Â On the one hand they are easy to use and contain lots of built in functionality.Â On the other hand they are abused by almost everyone but at the same time severely under utilized, meaning that I rarely see anyone use most of the features available.&#xA;I get the feeling that the majority of developers that use DataSets have blinders on:Â DataSets are only useful for reading and writing data to the database.</description>

      <description>So I was reviewing PEAA looking to see if Fowler had come up with the idea of Measurment Objects, that horse I&amp;rsquo;ve been kicking around lately.Â I found that he has a couple of close patterns:Â Value Object and Money.&#xA;Value Object:Â A small simple object, like money or a date range, whose equality isn&amp;rsquo;t based on identity.&#xA;Money: Represents a monetary value.&#xA;According to FowlerÂ Value Objects are light weight and almost primative types.</description>

      <description>In my previous post I described setting up a database to track measurements.Â I ran into problems quickly with the data model and I could see that it was going to become a convoluted mess pretty quick.Â So I want to take a step back and look at it from an application point of view.&#xA;What I want is a way to track an objects measurements.Â I need a system that is easy to understand, any one looking at an object should readily understand what each measurement property is and what units it is in.</description>

I can generalize this to any type of data store, they all suck.&#xA;OK, they don&amp;rsquo;t really suck but I sure have seen a lot of database designs that do.Â I am tired of working with applications that have lots and lots of large tables, tables with lots and lots of fields.Â Of course all the fields but the primary key are nullable because you might not always need that extra address field but it is there, just in case.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reviewing the ExcelPackage project on CodePlex. It is a useful project but one thing I was wondering is why does it directly interact with the XML?&#xA;I think it is a performance and a code maintenance hit to work directly with the XML for the workbook and worksheets. In my oh so humble opinion I think it would be easier to create plain old C# objects to work with the cells, rows, sheets, etc.</description>

      <description>Now that we have this cool Validation Application Block we want to use it with all our business objects. This should immediately send up a red flag that there will probably be some common functionality among all these business objects in how they use the Validation Application Block. Hence some type of layer supertype ( business base class ) will probably be necessary to contain common functionality to remove code redundancy.</description>

Integrated Virtual Debugger - Workstation integrates with Visual Studio and Eclipse so you can deploy, run, and debug programs in a VM directly from your preferred IDE Headless mode - You can run VMs in the background without the Workstation UI These new features will help me at work as it really does fit into my work style.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with VMWare and vitalization for a while now and I have to say I really like it.Â I have a virtual Ubuntu image that I am using to learn Ruby on Rails with.Â I installed VMWare&amp;rsquo;s server on my file server so I can run VM&amp;rsquo;s from any PC in my house.&#xA;So last night I was working on my gateway PC when the thought hit me:Â Why not create my own virtual domain?</description>

      <description>I am working on automating our build process and one of the things I am trying to do now is to add FxCop to the mix.Â There are a couple of ways to run the process, one using an exec task to call the executable directly, the other is through a Contrib task .&#xA;I tried the first method with no success.Â For some reason I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the output file name to be recognized by the executable.</description>

      <description>I have had the joy of reviewing other peoples code lately and I must say that for the most part there is a total lack of attention to detail.Â Extensive use of copy paste coding, but the one thing that bugs me the most is the naming convention used.&#xA;Can you believe that there are still developers that preface there variables with obj?!Â Is that not just crazy?Â Of course it is an object, we work in an OOP language.</description>

      <description>I keep seeing the commercial for Gears of War, I don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about the game but the background music is one that I know and like. It is called &amp;ldquo;Mad World&amp;rdquo; and I recognize it from the movie Donny Darko. Part of it goes like this:&#xA;I find it kind of funny,&#xA;I find it kind of sad,&#xA;But the dreams in which I&amp;rsquo;m dying&#xA;Are the best I ever had.</description>

      <title>Coding Horror: Properties vs. Public Variables</title>

      <description>Why waste everyone&amp;rsquo;s time with a bunch of meaningless just-in-case wrapper code? Start with the simplest thing that works&amp;ndash; a public variable. You can always refactor this later into a property if it turns out additional work needs to be done when the name value is set. If you truly need a property, then use a property. Otherwise, KISS! Update: As many commenters have pointed out, there are valid reasons to make a trivial property, exactly as depicted above:</description>

      <description>Ok, so I found another alternative to BlogJet: Performancing.Â This is an extension of FireFox so I have to have that installed.&#xA;So far it looks like it is easy to use.Â It can&amp;rsquo;t seem to be able to insert an image like Live Writer but I think it will be easier to blog about something I found on the web.&#xA;I have a feeling I will keep using Live Writer and only use this on occasion.</description>

      <description>So I just heard about the Windows Live Writer Beta.Â I am a big fan of BlogJet so when I heard about this new Microsoft program I was skeptical.Â So far I like it.&#xA;Now if it uploads this picture then I will have a reason to start using it and not use BlogJet.&#xA;I am always on the lookout for new and better tools.Â If this does what I need it to do then I will switch to it.</description>

      <description>I was working on a stored procedure the other day, not one that I wrote originally but one that was causing performance issues in out system. The procedure was taking any where from 40 to 60 seconds to run, which is unacceptable in a web service. This in fact was causing the web service to time out.&#xA;An inspection of the execution plan showed that one part of the procedure was doing an index scan and that it was this that was taking up over 85% of the execution time.</description>

Letâs not forget that Hanselminutes is Hosted by Carl Franklin. Carl sounds like the Java guy I work with; every time Scott brings up something that is not Microsoft or .</description>

      <description>OK, so I have seen bad code in the past.Â Hell, Iâve written some pretty bad code in the past, present and will in the future.Â But what I am looking at right now just blows my freaking mind.&#xA;A stored procedure that generates dynamic SQL to parse an XML document stored in a table which then somehow drives a cursor to fetch one row from something the dynamic sql calls that then drives another cursor that uses OPENXML to get data from another xml document.</description>

      <description>So, we are doing XP want to be development at work.Â It is more of a war room programming environment and not true paired programming.Â What I am finding that I like more and more is not the coding per say, but the testing and development automation.Â I have been using TestDriven.NET and mbUnit a lot and am just now starting to explore NCover.Â Also, have been using NAnt scripting for builds and have installed CruiseControl.</description>

      <description>Iâve tried several Linux distributions: Redhat, Coral, Suse, Mandrake, Damn Small Linux, Knoppix, Gentoo and finally Debian.Â Of all of these I was most loyal to Gentoo because it was the distro I learned the most with.Â The problem with Gentoo though is you spend so much time getting it to run and tweaking it that you donât really get to use the machine for what you want to.&#xA;For example, I tried and successfully setup a Gentoo desktop on a couple of occasions.</description>

      <description>I finished reading Sandman #9, The Kindly Ones.Â This was a very complicated Sandman, and for the Sandman saga that is saying something.Â Almost all the old characters returned and a lot of loose threads were tied or cut.Â Then Neil killed Dream.&#xA;I thought, how inappropriate.Â I didnât think he would actually kill him, just make him wipe out the furies.Â But no, Dream goes bye-bye.&#xA;This was actually foreshadowed in the previous Sandman, with the storm and the funeral march.</description>

      <description>The December 2004 issue of MSDN contains an article on developing CF apps. Part of the article advocates the disposing of forms as soon as you are done using them in order to conserve memory. I disagree with this.&#xA;I have found that caching forms improves the performance of a CF application. It takes a long time to load a form in CF so why should I make the user wait every time he has to reopen the same form?</description>

      <description>The Period Matrix table, Pd_Matrix, is used in calculating accounting period formulas. These formulas include current month, quarter or years activity or balance. These formulas can also be created using standard SQL functions but not all functions are common between SQL Server and MS Access. The Period Matrix has the advantage in that it can be used in any DBMS and it also can be used in table pivoting and folding.</description>

      <description>Pivoting a table on multiple columns with a crosstab query gets messy really fast.Â To eliminate the need for complicated Multiple Value Field Queries you can use the lowly IIF() function and the obscure CHOOSE() function to pivot a table.&#xA;Activity Table The table Activity used in this example has the following layout:&#xA;AcctID DeptID Class Year BeginBalance Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec The AcctID and DeptID refer to account and department numbers, which are a part of our fictitious companyâs accounting key.</description>

      <description>CrossTab queries are an easy way in MS Access to pivot tables. They are limited in that you can only pivot on one field and can only aggregate one field.&#xA;As an example we look at Activity table in the Sample.mdb. If we were asked to show the January activity for each account - department combination for each year using a crosstab query, we would create the following SQL:&#xA;TRANSFORM Sum(Activity.</description>

      <description>A big problem I have with people who consider themselves programmers is that they spend most of their time chasing the technology.Â They spend more time whack-a-mole code hacking and no time trying to learn the basics, like source control, methodologies or algorithms.&#xA;I personally lack in these areas because I do not come from a Computer Science background, but I strive to overcome this.Â My favorite computer books deal with ways of thinking about and doing programming, not just code cookbooks.</description>

<p>I am focusing mainly on creating Warriors for now.  I have created four different characters, two on a Pacific server and two on one of the Central servers.  I found that the Pacific servers are always over crowded and more prone to lag and other issues so I switched to the Central servers.</p>
<p>I have one main character that I am running now, a Night Elf Warrior.  I am following the template from PC Gamer for a High DPS Warrior, going to see how effective it is.  Right now the character is level 13 and I am focusing on getting his professional/trade skills higher.  Since he is a Warrior he has Blacksmith and Mining.   Of course he has first aid and cooking, those two are a must.</p>

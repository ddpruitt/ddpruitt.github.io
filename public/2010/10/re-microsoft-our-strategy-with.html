<p>I think it is time to move away from the Microsoft platform.  I&rsquo;m getting tired of having to learn a new framework every year just to keep up with their changes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Silverlight at work and I like it but if there is not going to be any support or they totally re-target the platform for just phones, whats the point?</p>

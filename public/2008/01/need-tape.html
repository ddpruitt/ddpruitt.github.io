Those are the words spoken to me by my son. He was playing with his GI Joe (one of the fake all plastic ones) when he accidentally pulled off its head. Oops!</p>
<p>This sucks because now I have to retape the head on evy time it falls off.</p>
<p>Of course the real GI Joe&rsquo;s head wouldn&rsquo;t have come off so easy. Growing up we used to regularly abuse them by dropping them off of roofs, blowing them up with fire works, running them over with the car, etc. and they always survived. These cheap plastic ripe offs, well they just suck.</p>

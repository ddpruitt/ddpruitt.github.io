## Adafruit METRO 328
The Arduino board used is the Adafruit METRO 328

Detailed specifications:

* ATmega328 microcontroller with Optiboot (UNO) Bootloader
* USB Programming and debugging via the well-supported genuine CP2104
* Input voltage: 7-9V (a 9VDC power supply is recommended)
* 5V regulator can supply peak ~800mA as long as the die temp of the regulator does not exceed 150*C
* 3.3V regulator can supply peak ~150mA as long as the die temp of the regulator does not exceed 150*C
* 5V logic with 3.3V compatible inputs, can be converted to 3.3V logic operation
* 20 Digital I/O Pins: 6 are also PWM outputs and 6 are also Analog Inputs
* 6-pin ICSP Header for reprogramming
* 32KB Flash Memory - 0.5K for bootloader, 31.5KB available after bootloading
* 16MHz Clock Speed
* Compatible with "Classic" and "R3" Shields
* Adafruit Black PCB with gold plate on pads
* 53mm x 71mm / 2.1" x 2.8"
* Height (w/ barrel jack): 13mm / 0.5"
* Weight: 19g
* Derivative of "[Arduino UNO R3 Reference design](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno)"

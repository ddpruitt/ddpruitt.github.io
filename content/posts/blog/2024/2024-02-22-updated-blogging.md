After many years I am finally making changes to my blog.  No more blogger or WordPress, those days are over.  Nope, on to static web pages using Hugo.

The goal is to write the blog posts using Obsidian or VS Code.  The posts are just markdown so i can commit them directly to git.  Using GitHub Actions I setup Hugo to automatically rebuild the site and publish to GitHub pages on commits.

I've spent some time converting my old blog posts, such as they are, to the Markdown format.  I had to export the posts from blogger then run a convert to transform the xml to markdown.  After much clean up I managed to get the pages clean.

I'm playing around with different themes for Hugo now to find one that I like and is easy to use.  One that has a lot of features but doesn't require any special GitHub repo templates to setup and use.  I want to be able to use the Hugo site and be able to change the theme whenever I want.

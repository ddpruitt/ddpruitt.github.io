[Ralf's Sudelbücher : .NET naked - See these hitherto unpublished pictures of the .NET Framework architecture](http://weblogs.asp.net/ralfw/archive/2006/08/27/.NET-naked-_2D00_-See-these-hitherto-unpublished-pictures-of-the-.NET-Framework-architecture.aspx).

  

Ralf demonstrates how a Dependency Structure Matrix can reveal the overall architecture quality of a product.  A very cool concept and another tool to add to the toolbox.

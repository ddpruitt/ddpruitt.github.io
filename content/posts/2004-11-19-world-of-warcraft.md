[Blizzard Entertainment - World of Warcraft](http://www.blizzard.com/wow/) I have been waiting for over three years for WOW to come out. Is it worth the wait? Am I going to rush and play it? Should I? After all these years are online dungeons even relevant?

**UPDATE:**  My wife bought me the game for Christmas, but she said I can't open it until Christmas!  But we are going to Flint, MI for Christmas so I won't be able to play it until New Years Eve, when we get back.  Oh the humanity of it all!

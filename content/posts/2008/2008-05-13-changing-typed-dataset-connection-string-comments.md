Still sounds like a workaround. Thats always was my problem too. But... what do I do if I want, in DAL, at design time, work to my main project connection string?

It is a workaround and not one I really like. But it worked so I just accepted it and moved onto the next issue.  
  
I would think that if you wanted to work in your main project at design time but point to your main DB, not your DAL DB, then something like:  
  
if (DesignMode)  
EquipmentConnectionSettings.SetEquipmentToConnectToMdb(mdbName);

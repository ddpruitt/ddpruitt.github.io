[![](http://blog.ddpruitt.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/WindowsLiveWriter/WindowsLiveWriter_13254/DSC02891_thumb%5B12%5D.jpg)](http://blog.ddpruitt.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/WindowsLiveWriter/WindowsLiveWriter_13254/DSC02891%5B14%5D.jpg)So I just heard about the Windows Live Writer Beta.  I am a big fan of BlogJet so when I heard about this new Microsoft program I was skeptical.  So far I like it.

Now if it uploads this picture then I will have a reason to start using it and not use BlogJet.

I am always on the lookout for new and better tools.  If this does what I need it to do then I will switch to it.

So, we are doing XP want to be development at work.  It is more of a war room programming environment and not true paired programming. 

What I am finding that I like more and more is not the coding per say, but the testing and development automation.  I have been using TestDriven.NET and mbUnit a lot and am just now starting to explore NCover.  Also, have been using NAnt scripting for builds and have installed CruiseControl.NET to see if I can’t get an entire build cycle created.

This is all exciting stuff!

I have been saying for the last couple of years that once we get true TV on demand we will stop becoming slaves to the networks. [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/) and [Google Video](http://video.google.com/) are the start of that phenomena.

The thing I just found out about YouTube is that you can embed videos in any post and not worry about actually hosting the video.  See my post on the [Blue Man Group](http://blog.ddpruitt.net/2006/08/18/blue-man-group-rocks/) for an example.

I have had the joy of reviewing other peoples code lately and I must say that for the most part there is a total lack of attention to detail.  Extensive use of copy paste coding, but the one thing that bugs me the most is the naming convention used.

Can you believe that there are still developers that preface there variables with obj?!  Is that not just crazy?  Of course it is an object, we work in an OOP language.

Everyone should stop reading tips and tricks sites and start reading books on how to program.

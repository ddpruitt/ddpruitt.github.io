Ok, so I found another alternative to BlogJet: Performancing.  This is an extension of FireFox so I have to have that installed.  
  
So far it looks like it is easy to use.  It can't seem to be able to insert an image like Live Writer but I think it will be easier to blog about something I found on the web.  
  
I have a feeling I will keep using Live Writer and only use this on occasion.

powered by [performancing firefox](http://performancing.com/firefox)  OK I don't like that Performancing does self promoting.  That is a big minus.

Just got an email about the 6.0 version of the VMWare Workstation and all I can say is "Wow!"  These are the features I am mainly interested in:

*   Multiple monitor display - You can configure a VM to span multiple monitors, or multiple VMs to each display on separate monitors.
*   Integrated Virtual Debugger - Workstation integrates with Visual Studio and Eclipse so you can deploy, run, and debug programs in a VM directly from your preferred IDE
*   Headless mode - You can run VMs in the background without the Workstation UI

These new features will help me at work as it really does fit into my work style.  The next PC I get I'm going to install a base system then VM's for everything else, all development will be done in a VM sandboxes.

The question now becomes:  Will VMServer have these features?

I have to use the Cisco VPN Client at work and man when it breaks it breaks good!  For some reason it has decided to stop working which means I can’t work at home.  Now I have to spend my Saturday morning in the office.  CRAP!

  

I’ve been looking for an alternative but can’t seem to find one.  If anyone knows of a good alternative please let me know.

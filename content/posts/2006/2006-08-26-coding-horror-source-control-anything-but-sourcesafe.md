[Coding Horror: Source Control: Anything But SourceSafe](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000660.html).

  

Visual Source Safe sucks.  Jeff Atwood explains in no uncertain terms why it sucks and I just want to get my vote in.  The two most important issues he points out is that VSS gives the illusion of safety and VSS users _DON’T BRANCH_!

  

They fear branching because it takes so much time and it is just a foreign concept to them.

  

Do yourself a favor, get a real tool.  Be a real programmer.

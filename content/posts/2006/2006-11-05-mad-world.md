I keep seeing the commercial for _Gears of War_, I don't know anything about the game but the background music is one that I know and like. It is called "Mad World" and I recognize it from the movie Donny Darko. Part of it goes like this:  

> I find it kind of funny,  
>   
> I find it kind of sad,  
>   
> But the dreams in which I'm dying  
>   
> Are the best I ever had.

  
It is one of those songs that forces you to stop and listen.  
  
Any way, I thought I might have the song so I went looking in my mp3 collection and couldn't find it. No problem I'll search iTunes.  
  
Do you know how many remakes are of this one song?! A lot. Just on iTunes I see over 52 remixes.  
  
Wow.

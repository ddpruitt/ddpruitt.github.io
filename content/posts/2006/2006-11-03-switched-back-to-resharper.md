I uninstalled CodeRush and re-installed ReSharper.  CodeRush just wasn't doing anything for me productivity wise.  I felt that I spent more time fighting it then working with it.

Maybe I just feel more comfortable with ReSharper.  I feel that with it I don't have to memorize as many key combinations.

I'll give it another month and see what I think then.

The utility of the week is [FileHelpers](http://filehelpers.sourceforge.net/), a .Net library that works with delimited and fixed length files. It helps to import and export data from files, strings or streams.  
  
I found this recently as I needed to process several CSV files but I did not want to write by hand a parser. Been there, done that way too many times so I did a search and what do you know- someone smarter than me already did it.  
  
What I like about it is the wizard that comes with the library that helps to build plain old c# classes to work with the data rows. In about twenty minutes I had a working CSV processing engine complete with intellisense.

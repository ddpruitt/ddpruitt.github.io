[InfoQ: WAF and Caliburn: 2 WPF Application Frameworks](http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/08/WAF-Caliburn)

Two MVVM frameworks.

[WAF](http://waf.codeplex.com) is backed by the patterns & practices team (waf.codeplex.com).

[Caliburn](http://caliburnproject.org) though is said to be more mature (caliburnproject.org).

A third framework mentioned in the notes is [mvvmlight](http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com) ([mvvmlight.codeplex.com](http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/08/WAF-Caliburn#view_59766)).

## Debugging NuGet Packages with Source Link

Reference: [Improved .NET Debugging Experience with Source Link - NDepend]([https://blog.ndepend.com/improved-net-debugging-experience-with-source-link/](https://blog.ndepend.com/improved-net-debugging-experience-with-source-link/))

> Source Link is language, IDE and source-control agnostic. Source Link can be used from debugging sessions done through Visual Studio, VS Code or Rider IDE.

The example given in the article uses an existing package, Newtonsoft.Json.  I want to create a NuGet package from scratch and enable Source Link.

So says my bossman at least.  And such is the attitude of a lot of programmers.

But it is not All That Matters.  It is a side affect of doing things right and an accident when you do things wrong.  There is more to building software, lots more, and it is unfortunate that some people will never see beyond the short sided goals of "Making it Work."

It kills me to here people I work with say that.  Sometimes I feel that I am the only person innovating, or even just trying to improve my work practices.  I have to fight to make them use source control much less follow any kind of standard development procedure.

I try to lead by example but that does not work.  I give up.

Power Collections: [http://www.wintellect.com/powercollections/](http://www.wintellect.com/powercollections/)

The Power Collections Library is an open source collection class library for the next version of .NET. The philosophy of the library is to extend the base class library (BCL) of collection classes that will be available with .NET 2.0 rather than provide a complete and separate set of classes from .NET.

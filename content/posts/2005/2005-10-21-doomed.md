Those Who Ignore Standards Are Doomed to Reinvent Them
------------------------------------------------------

The most Prophetic words I have ever heard.

This has come into play several times where I work and where I have worked.  It boils down to each developer thinking his set of _Standards_ is better then my set of _Standards_.

The others should just face reality:  I know best so do it my way.  ![](http://www.myhosting.com/blog/smile1.gif)

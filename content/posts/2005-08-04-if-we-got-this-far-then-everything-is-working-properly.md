Comment found in a code that I was reviewing:

_if we got this far, then everything is working properly_

Why does this send shivers up my spine?  The procedure is 91 lines long and this comment appears on line 43.  What about the other 48 lines?  What if they fail? 

I should add the following comment to the end of the procedure:

_if we got this far then there is a God._

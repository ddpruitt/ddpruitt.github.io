> Welcome to G-Ding.TV, home of MythDora. MythDora is a Fedora Core and MythTV "All-In-One" CD. The CD will load a preconfigured Fedora Core 4 installation on your computer as well as install and configure MythTV-0.19. There are extras included with MythDora such as MythBurn, MediaMVP and MythStreamTV for some extra fun. Enjoy!

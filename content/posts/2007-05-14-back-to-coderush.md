Last week I went to the Houston .Net User Group ([HDNUG](http://www.hdnug.org "HDNUG")) to listen to [Claudio Lassala](http://claudiolassala.spaces.live.com/ "Claudio Lassala") speak about tips and tricks. If you ever get a chance to hear Claudio I highly recommend going, he is a natural born public speaker and is always entertaining and full of useful information. Imagine a Brazilian Scott Hanselman with a sense of humor and long hair.  
  
The talk was about tips and tricks to make a developers daily work easier. A lot of the tips and utilities he showed I had already known about and used (mainly through listening to Hanselman) but it was still fun to see someone else use them. One of the tools he showed was CodeRush which I have talked about before ( here )

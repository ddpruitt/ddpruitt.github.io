I finished reading Sandman #9, _The Kindly Ones_.  This was a very complicated Sandman, and for the Sandman saga that is saying something.  Almost all the old characters returned and a lot of loose threads were tied or cut.  Then Neil killed Dream.

I thought, how inappropriate.  I didn’t think he would actually kill him, just make him wipe out the furies.  But no, Dream goes bye-bye.

This was actually foreshadowed in the previous Sandman, with the storm and the funeral march.

I am trying to avoid reading any reviews of the final Sandman just so I don’t know what is going to happen.  After I finish the final I can go back and re-read the Endless Nights.

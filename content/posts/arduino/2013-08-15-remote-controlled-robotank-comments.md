Great stuff, sir! Good examples of function pointers and strtok.  
A modest improvement suggestion, since there may be beginners learning from your examples - Use a #define for the number of commands instead of a value of 7:  
#define NUMCOMMANDS 7  
Then use NUMCOMMANDS in your array definitions and the loop.  
Best regards and thanks for the great post.

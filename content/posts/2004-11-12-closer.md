Scott Peterson is found guilty.  Finally, maybe this will become a non-issue now.  I'm sick of hearing about this case, Who Cares!  There are far worse atrocities going on in the world, who cares about this cheap ass punk?

Arafat is dead.  Finally!  He did nothing but cause problems.  Maybe now the Palestinians can get some solid leadership.

The election is a solid win.

What ever are the reporters going to harp on now?  I'm sure they will find something, the bastards.

I’ve have discovered virtualization.  Actually I started using it several months ago and found that it is GREAT!  It Rocks My World!!

After trying Microsoft's I decided that I preferred VMWare’s Virtual Server, mainly because there is a version for Linux.  I have a plan to build the ultimate home server using VM’s.

However, tonight I had just downloaded the SourceForge Enterprise VM and was going to play with it but my license key for VMWare Virtual Server had expired.  When I tried to get a new one their server returned a nice little Tomcat error:

```
javax.servlet.ServletException: JesapiFilter: Invalid Remote
      Address.
```

That sucks because now I have to uninstall the server and install the VMPlayer.  blah.  But, it is all free so who am I to complan.

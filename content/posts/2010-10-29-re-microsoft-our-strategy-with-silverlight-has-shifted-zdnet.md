“Silverlight is our development platform for Windows Phone,” he said. Silverlight also has some “sweet spots” in media and line-of-business applications, he said.  
  
But when it comes to touting Silverlight as Microsoft’s vehicle for delivering a cross-platform runtime, “our strategy has shifted,” Muglia told me.

I think it is time to move away from the Microsoft platform.  I'm getting tired of having to learn a new framework every year just to keep up with their changes.  
  
I've been using Silverlight at work and I like it but if there is not going to be any support or they totally re-target the platform for just phones, whats the point?
